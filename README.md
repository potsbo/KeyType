# KeyType

This app remaps key inputs to another just like Karabiner but with configuration hard code.
Karabiner is more flexible and easier to use but sometimes it doesn't work with latest macOS.
In those cases I ([@potsbo](https://github.com/potsbo)) use this app to configure key remaps.

I don't any plan to make this app configurable but feel free to fork this project to simulate your own configuration.
